# Hi, I'm Monique Moguel
I am a determined cybersecurity learner with a growing focus on threat detection, investigation and blue team defense. I'm building my portfolio with tools like **Splunk**, **TryHackMe**, and **SIEM simulation labs**. I am documeting my progress, failures included, to showcase my thinking, growth and readiness to solve real-world security problems. 

----
### Why Cybersecurity?
I believe digital safety should be accessible, proactive and personal. My goal is to learn fast, think critically and **stand out not by perfection but by persistence**

### Featured projects (In Progress)
These are the hands-on cybersecurity labs and investigations I am actively building. Each project repo will include my detailed notes, screenshots, take aways and what I would do differently in a real SOC. 

----

### Splunk labs - Beginner Blue Team projects
[Visit repo] (https://github.com/moniquemoguel/splunk-labs) *(Coming soon)

Hands on lab series using free Splunk datasets to simulate real-world security use cases. Projects include:
- Failed login brute-force detection
- DNS tunneling identification
- Basic SIEM log parsing and query crafting
- Alert explanation breakdowns (why it triggered, what it means, what to do)

Each lab is written like a junior SOC Analyst's incident report with screenshots, notes and action steps. 

----

### TryHackMe Blue Team Path - Threat Hunting + Incident Response 
[Visit repo] (https://github.com/moniquemoguel/THM-BlueTeam-Journal)

My personal learning journal from TryHackMe's Blue Team training. All exercises include:
- Objectives for each lab
- Key concepts I struggled with and how I solved them.
- Realistic detection strategies using Splunk, Wireshark and other tools.
- Analyst-style takeaways I'd bring to a SOC role.

Organized like a playbook to demonstrate technical ability, as well as how I *think* through security alerts. 

----

### Custom Threat Simulation lab (Home Setup)
[Visit Repo] (https://github.com/moniquemoguel/HomeLab-Incident-Sims) *(Coming Soon)*

Planned local lab where I simulate real world securty incidents using:

- A Linux-based detection box
- Wireshark, Suricata, Burp Suite and Splunk Free
- Scenarios like phishing payloads, unauthorized access and log correlation

This repo will show my full lab setup, configurations, captured artifacts and documented investigations with MITRE ATT&CK references. 

----

### What I'm building toward
- SOC or Blue Team Analyst role
- Home lab with simulated attacks and detections
- Security+ and Blue Team Level certification
- Confidence with SIEMs, scripting and critical analysis

----

### How I work

I document my process, reflect on challenges and prioritize **understanding over shortcuts**. I believe that attention to detail + storytelling is what seperates someone who *knows security* from someone who can *own security*. 

----

### Let's Connect
I'm actively building, learning and opn to collaboration, mentorship and junior SOC opportunities.
